If stuck with circular error or migration/migrate problem,
Then follow below steps to resolve it,

First of all, If in development mode then only follow this steps otherwise you'll lose data.

step: Clean up your DB & migrations.

step 1: Drop your DB again:
    mysql -u root -p -e "DROP DATABASE yourdbname; CREATE DATABASE yourdbname CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"

step 2: Delete all migration files except __init__.py:
    find . -path "*/migrations/*.py" -not -name "__init__.py" -delete

step 3: Regenerate migrations in two passes:
    First for authentication only:
        python manage.py makemigrations authentication
        python manage.py migrate authentication

    Then for master_data:
        python manage.py makemigrations master_data
        python manage.py migrate master_data
